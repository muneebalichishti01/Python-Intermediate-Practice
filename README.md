# Python-Intermediate-Practice

This repository is dedicated to enhancing my Python programming skills at an intermediate level. It serves as a continuation of my learning journey thus building upon foundational knowledge and diving deeper into more advanced concepts and practical applications.

## Topics Covered

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Classes and Objects
   - Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation
   - Abstract Classes and Interfaces

2. **Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)**
   - Building desktop applications using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt

3. **Capstone Projects**
   - Real-world projects to consolidate learning and apply concepts

4. **Exception and Error Handling**
   - Handling runtime errors gracefully
   - Creating and using custom exceptions

5. **JSON and CSV Data Handling**
   - Reading and writing JSON and CSV files
   - Parsing and manipulating structured data

6. **APIs and Authentication**
   - Consuming RESTful APIs
   - Implementing authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth)

7. **Web Development**
   - Building web applications using Flask
   - Integrating Bootstrap for responsive design

8. **Bots**
   - Creating automation scripts and chatbots

9. **Flask and Bootstrap**
   - Combining Flask with Bootstrap for full-stack web development

## My Approach

I will go through these topics systematically, practicing good coding practices and working on meaningful examples and exercises. This repository will document my progress, including code snippets, notes and any challenges I encounter along the way.

For larger or real-world projects, I plan to create separate repositories. These new repositories will focus on applying the concepts learned here to build complete & robust applications. This approach will allow me to keep this repository focused on intermediate-level learning and practice while dedicating other repositories to specific projects.

This practice is separate from my earlier **14 Days of Practice - Python Basics**, where I focused on foundational concepts through small daily projects. Now, the focus shifts to intermediate-level programming to tackle more complex problems and build larger & more robust applications.
